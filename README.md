## Notes for Group to get started: 
1) Clone the repo 
2) run npm install 
3) make sure MONGO DB server is running (go run mongod) 
4) `npm run dev` will trigger a script to launch the server and the app together (node server.js won't work on its own). 

If you run into errors getting your local skeleton set up and started, contact Joe on Slack
