## Notes for Group to get started: 
1) Clone the repo 
2) run `npm install` 
3) run `npm install nodemon -g` to make sure nodemon is installed globally 
3) make sure your MONGO DB server is running on your computer (go run mongod - contact Joe if you don't know how) 
4) running `npm run dev` will trigger a script to launch the server and the app together (node server.js won't work on its own). 

If you run into errors getting this local skeleton set up and started, contact Joe on Slack
